# FE1 Kit

Focus: Frontend core (shell, routing, layout).

Contents:
- hello.js (tiny placeholder)
- .gitkeep files for structure.

Next steps after full code push:
- Take ownership of `frontend/src/App.jsx`, `frontend/src/main.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Layout/*`, routing setup, and top-level theme.
